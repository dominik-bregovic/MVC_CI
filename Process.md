##The Project so far:##

**Creating the workflow**

The file in github was going very well. The instructins were clear and easy to follow.

**Maven and it's features:**

*Validation:*
Easy to implement. No problems appeared

*Compiling:*
Easy to implement. No problems appeared

*Testing:*
Here we had to include the "maven-surefire-plugin" in order to include Unit-testing for our builds.
First we tried to include it over the dependencies, which failed.
After that we tried to include it over the plugins, which succeeded.

We implemented a simple test that just checks for a empty string. This was just to get it going.
Further implementations will follow.

*Packaging:*
Here we excluded the test from being executed. We have done this before and don't want to add redundancy.
Besides that the packaging was going as planed.

*Documentation with SITE:*
Here we have to improve the content of the doku but a basic documentation is provided.
